Summary
+++++++
- Each row in the dataset represents a match that has taken place in the Soccer World Cup between 1930 and 2014 inclusive.
- Each row includes details of where and when the match was played, which teams were playing against each other, and how many goals were scored by each team.


Definition of each field:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Year - year the match was played
- Date - the date of the match
- Time - the time that the match started
- Round - the round that the match was played in.  At a world cup, there are two stages: the Group stage, and the Knockout stage.  The Group stage consists of a number of groups (the number of groups in a World Cup has grown over the years) with teams in each group.  All teams within a group play each other, and the results determine who proceeds to the Knockout stage.  During the Knockout stage, teams play each other and the winner progresses to the next round; each round is played in the same way until two teams meet in the final.  There is also a Match for third place played between the losers of the semi-finals. Over the years the format has changed, and that is reflected in the data for each World Cup.  For example, in 1934 there were no Groups, just a Preliminary round.  The structure has remained relatively unchanged since 1986 (the only change has been expansion of the number of groups in the Group stage).
- Stadium - the stadium that the game was played in
- City - the city that the game was played in
- Country - the country that the game was played in (each World Cup year is hosted by a different country, so there is only one country per year)
- HomeTeam - the team treated as the Home Team for the match.  This does not affect the outcome, only things like which shirts are worn.
- HomeGoals - the number of goals scored in the match by the HomeTeam
- AwayGoals - the team treated as the Home Team for the match.  This does not affect the outcome, only things like which shirts are worn.
- AwayTeam - the number of goals scored in the match by the AwayTeam
- Observation - optional field, giving more insight into the match where necessary.  For example, when a score is tied in the Knockout stage during normal time, a team may win during extra time, or may win thanks to a Golden Goal, or may win on penalties.
